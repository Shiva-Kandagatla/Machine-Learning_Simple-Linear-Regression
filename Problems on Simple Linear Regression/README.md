## Here are some problem statements on Simple Linear Regression. The Datasets are also provided. They are inside their respective folder.

### Problem 1: 
	Consider the following set of points: {(-2 , -1) , (1 , 1) , (3 , 2)} 
	
	a) Find the least square regression line for the given data points. 
	b) Plot the given points and the regression line in the same rectangular system of axes. 

### Problem 2:
	Consider the following set of points : {(-1 , 0),(0 , 2),(1 , 4),(2 , 5)}
	
	a) Find the least square regression line for the following set of data
	b) Plot the given points and the regression line in the same rectangular system of axes. 

### Problem 3:
	The values of x and their corresponding values of y are shown in the table below 
	x  0  1  2  3  4
	y  2  3  5  4  6

	a) Find the least square regression line y = a x + b. 
	b) Estimate the value of y when x = 10.

### Problem 4:
	The sales of a company (in million dollars) for each year are shown in the table below. 
	x (year)  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009
	y (sales)  12    19    29    37    45

	a) Find the least square regression line y = a x + b. 
	b) Use the least squares regression line as a model to estimate the sales of the company in 2012.
